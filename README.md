# Open Forward NN [ofnn]

An open (accessible parameters), feed-forward-only NN (neural net) library to use it in an dynamic and free way in evolutionary algorithms. Design is influenced by the Keras Sequetial model.

If you need backpropagation learning, it should be possible to add it without a lot of problems. Feel free to contribute!
